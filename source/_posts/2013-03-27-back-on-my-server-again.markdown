Now that I have things straightened out after the reinstall on my Mac
Mini, I have migrated my blog from GitHub onto my website domain. I like
this much better than redirecting to my GitHub page. Now I can work
towards adding more in depth Ruby functionality in other pages of my
blog. This took a while to get migrated because after I resinstalled OS
X onto my Mac Mini, (upgraded to RAID SSDâ€™s) the app broke and would not
deploy. Then I put off fixing it for a while to work more on my Android
app. I am to a good point on the BaristaLog app where I can hold off on
adding more functionality and refining the UI until it is tested more
thouroughly. So now I am woking more on my Ruby-Foo.
