##My attempt to use Maven, Cucumber, Robotium, JUnit and Jenkins
together with Android.

As i grow as a developer I am always trying to learn new techniques and
tools, and I try to implement them into the projects I am currently
working on. I have recentley benn on a TDD/BDD/QA kick and have been
looking for an excuse to use a bunch of these tools together without too
much disaster. I am starting another Android app to be released to ther
oogle Play market.
