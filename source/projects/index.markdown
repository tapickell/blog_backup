##Giddy Goat iPhone App  
In March of 2012 I was contracted by The Giddy Goat Coffee House to create an iPhone application for use by thier clients. This app is available from the [App Store](http://appstore.com/giddygoat). It has a daily specials feature that can be updated with ease. It lists all of the coffee based drinks and gives the user a description about the drink selected. It can also bring up the stores location in the map app so the user can get directions to or bookmark the location. For iOS6 I utilized the new social integration features to allow users to tweet or post to facebook directly from the app.  

##Giddy Goat Android App 
In November of 2012 I was contracted again by The Giddy Goat Coffee House to create an Android application for use by thier clients. This app is available from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.toddpickell.giddygoat). It has a daily specials feature that can be updated with ease. It lists all of the coffee based drinks and gives the user a description about the drink selected. It can also bring up the stores location in the map app so the user can get directions to or bookmark the location.  


##Barista Log Android App
I am currently wokring on an Andorid app for Barista's and coffee enthusiasts. It is a timer app with logging functionality. It has seperate timing functions for different types of coffee brewing devices like the Aeropress, Chemex, French Press and Pour Overs. These timers have different stages depending on the device, such as Steep, Bloom, Brew and Press. The timers are customizable for the users preferences. After a timer has finished there is an option to save a log note with the time, date and a description of who the coffee turned out. This is still in development and will be available onthe Google Play Store when complete.


##Call Center Bot
I am currently working on a Call Center Automation program that will help to automate redundant tasks in the workflow of a call center employee. This program will increase call center employee efficiency and consistancy. This project is utilizing JRuby, Java and the Swing framework to create a cross platform desktop application that will be able to control  remote desktop software, instant messenger programs and web browsers to automate as much of the daily workflow as possible.  


##Tmux Battery Display
I created a Ruby script that displays emoji in the tmux status line to represent a MacBook's current battery status. It has different icons for ac and battery power, also for fully charged, charging and discharging. I created this becuase I wanted an easy to see battery display for when I am working in Tmux and Vim. Clone it on [Github](https://github.com/myappleguy/tmux_battery_display) and try it out.


##Tmux Pomodoro Timer
I am creating an pomodoro timer app that displays the current time left for the pomodoro in the Tmux status bar. It uses emoji to display wether you are on an pom or a break. It uses terminal notifier to send a message to the notification center when the timer has finished. Still a [work](https://github.com/myappleguy/tmux_timer) in progress


##Java Asteroids Clone
I created a 2D asteroids clone in Java. It has the basic controls and feel of the classic asteroids that we all loved but with some updated grahics and sounds. I built the game in different stages as a demonstration of programming skills. Stage I is the most basic using shapes for graphics. Stage II is the same base game engine from Stage I with better graphics. I created it as a Java applet so that it is playable from within the [browser](http://toddpickell.me/JavaSite/Stage_II.html).


##Java desktop application
I also developed a small program in Java.This program was designed to assist people (my brother in-law) with his Composition I homework. The user can copy the body of a paper into a .txt file then run this program and enter in the full path of the file. It then creates a text file in the same directory that has Split appended to the name (myTextFileSplit.txt). This new txt file has every sentence on its own line w/ punctuation and line numbers. Perfect for those pesky Composition I assignments where Mr. Arthur has you write a paper and then wants a second copy with all the sentences numbered and double spaced. Clone this on [Github](https://github.com/myappleguy/JavaStuff/blob/master/JavaProgramming/MyJava/TestingTokens/src/TextSplitter/Main.java) and give it a try.
